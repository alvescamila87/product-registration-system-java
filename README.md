# PRS: Product Registration System
Product Registration System: Java language (SENAI, 2023)

## About the project
The Product Registration System was a project developed in the Java language during the evaluation system process: S.A of the SENAI/SC Institute of Education. This project started in Portugol language as the first development.

The system was implemented to allow the registration of various types of products, based on the requirements of this flowchart, composed of the functionality diagram for: product creation, product update, product deletion, product listing, product sorting, as well as by its classification, and addition and deletion of product inventory.

## Requirements to run
* Execute the project in Java language
* IDE used during the implementation: NetBeans or IntelliJ

## Trello | Documentation | QA
To develop the system, I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ONKmAir6/sa-portugol) with a board and a list of cards to help organize, and manage tasks, and documentation on how to implement them. I also included cards for improvements, bugs, questions and documentation to organize the project.

### Documentation 
I used user stories and test scenarios to support development.

### QA: 
I used the ScreenToGIF app to record gifs of tests for items when 100% tested and developed.
